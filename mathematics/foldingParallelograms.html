	  <h3>Showing what you wrote</h3>
	  <p>
		Paper, besides being a medium for writing mathematics on, can be used to
		do mathematics. If you discount the inaccuracies of the real world a
		sheet of paper is a plane that you can hold in your hands. Through
		folding this plane certain constructions can be done much faster than
		with a ruler and compass.

	  <h3>Bisection</h3>
	  <p>
		<!-- TODO: figure line bisection. -->
		The middle of a line segment is that point of the segment that divides
		it into two parts of equal length. How can you check if the two lengths
		are the same? Two line segments have the same length if their end
		points, possiblly through a rotation of one of the segments, can be made
		to conincide. And if you fold something in two you automatically have
		two segements with coinciding endpoints. The same thing works on paper.
		Any line segment on a sheet can be bisected just by bringing the ends
		together not just the edges of the sheet.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<!-- TODO: figure angle bisection. -->
		Angles can be bisected by a similar argument. By folding the two lines
		that define the angle so that they conincide at everypoint, the crease
		forms such that the two lines diverge from the crease at equal rates.
		The crease is then that line that bisects the angle.
