	  A great resource for when is comes to accessable design. She also did a

	  that gives a gentle introduction to what appears to be somewhat of
	  an arcane art.
	  Her <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/01/15/svg-filters-101/">article</a>
	  on SMIL animation is also a great reference.

	  Certainly one of the creator to whom the YouTube algorithm gives too
