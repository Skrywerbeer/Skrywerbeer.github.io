		Started as just a place to showcase and document my C++,ðŸ’Œ, projects
		and to a degree also as a personal alternative to the two dominant vitriol
		aggregator sites. But in the continuous course of the site's development
		it has been a source of further inspiration, projects and a deeper
		appreciation of this modern art medium.

		Starting with little html skills and a fair aquintance with javascript
		thanks to <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt and QML</a>. But JS for QML
		and JS for the web has some significant differences. With QML most
		of your javascript is simply going to be glue holding your elements,
		with C++ implementations together, on the web javascript is less
		of an adhesive and more a cohesive blob.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Armed with a vague memory most that javascript talks Youtube has recommended
		to me was about framework so and so, I head to google. Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript-based_web_frameworks">Wikipedia</a>
		comparison page and start opening some tabs. React is quickly disqualified
		(<i>Meta</i> ðŸ¤®). With some apprehension I finally decide on <a href="https://www.angular.io/">Angular.</a>
		I open some more tabs; close, figurativly, my eyes and take a dive into the
		documentation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Out of previous experience with Android and how shallow at times even
		obscure Google's documentation can be, I didn't have high hopes but was
		pleasantly surprised when I started reading. I still have some gripes,
		but who cares ðŸŽ».
	  </p>
	  <p>
		After installing everything, working through some examples and playing
		around a bit. It is decided I will use Angular. But living in a countryðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦
		with intermittent electricity means intermittent internet; so I hit the
		first snag. You can't create a new Angular workspace that is going to work
		without being online.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		A few commits later and a working skeleton, I noticed a mistake and
		wanted to revert back a couple of commits. Since I haven't uploaded
		anything to Github jet, and just in case, I create a backup.
		<code>cp -r</code> gets called and thumbs
		start twiddling. It takes too long. <code>Ctrl+C</code> and
		<code>du -hs</code>. 500M ðŸ˜®.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I realize that the actual build is only 280K. But still,
		for every workspace that you create just to experiment with something
		or just for fun/practice, you have 500M repeated across your disk.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Doubts started forming in my mind.
		<ul>
		  <li>Bloated workspace</li>
		  <li>Too little semantics in the DOM.</li>
		  <li>It takes forever to click through the tree to
			where my components are.</li>
		  <li>Angular.io tabs use too much RAM.</li>
		  <li>How much am I really using?</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Having in the mean time learned alot more javascript, played around
		with Web Components and having <a href="https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/i-made-this-website-with-html/">read</a>
		I realized for my use case that I don't need Angular or any framework
		really. Besides what is more personal than writing and designing
		everything yourself. This page and the lines of code that make it
		up is fully my own. With no dependencies besides the API's the browser
		provides. I hope it provides something useful to you. Comments and
		critique is always welcome.
