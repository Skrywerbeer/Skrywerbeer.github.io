  <h2>This site</h2>
  <p>
	Started as just a place to showcase and document my C++,ðŸ’Œ, projects
	and to a degree also as a personal alternative to the two dominant vitriol
	aggregator sites. But in the continuous course of the site's development
	it has been a source of further inspiration, projects and a deeper
	appreciation of this modern art medium.
